<p>The purpose of this project is provide a server to support services for classroom instruction and file-sharing.</p>

<h2 id="business-requirements">Business Requirements</h2>

<p>We would like an information system that will provide the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instructors should be able to share software with students over the local network.</li>
  <li>Instructors should be able to run services like source code servers, databases, or Jupyter Notebooks over the local network</li>
  <li>Instructors should be able to set up student accounts to allow students to connect to the server over the network and provide access to a common set of tools.</li>
  <li>The server should operate securely and receive updates.</li>
  <li>The server should be inaccessible outside of the network.</li>
  <li>General file sharing should be read-only for students.</li>
  <li>The system should not be connected to the Campus Internet Wifi Connection.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="expected-value">Expected Value</h1>

<h2 id="tangible">Tangible</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When software is downloaded from the Internet, it impacts network access.  If an entire classroom of students is downloading software for the class, it can shut down internet access completely.  This system would help provide unbroken internet access.</li>
  <li>When software is shared via flash drive, viruses from student computers infect the flash drive and are then transferred to other computers.  T?his system would be more secure than the current methods in place.</li>
  <li>Classroom instruction time is limited when waiting for software to be downloaded via the Internet or flash drives.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="intangible">Intangible</h2>

<ul>
  <li>With an on-site server, instructors will have options to integrate interactive lessons into their curriculum, adding education value and helping students immediately apply their learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="special-issues-or-constraints">Special Issues or Constraints</h2>

<p>The security of the server is of particular importance.</p>
